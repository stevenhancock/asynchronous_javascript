Using the random number code below, set up a generator function that will act as a producer of a random value. It should return a random number whenever next is invoked. Set the function up so it can be used to create a random number between 1 and 100 or 1 and 10 or between 1 and any number; basically the end number should be whatever is passed into the function.
